          <p>You start your journey by building a paginated table. In this case, it will load random data an will set dynamically the pagination and will enable/disable the right buttons to interact with it. TailwindCSS ensures the layout is responsive and visually appealing, highlighting hover rows.</p>

          <p>Next challenge is a dynamic todo list. This is not just a static list; users can add tasks, mark them complete, or delete them. Each task enters and leaves with smooth animations, fading or sliding into view. TailwindCSS ensures the layout is responsive and visually appealing, highlighting completed tasks differently from pending ones. By the end of this day, youâ€™ll have a fully functional, animated todo list.</p>

          <p>In this case, it will create a system of two different type of notifications that can be displayed to the user: a toast and a banner. Both of them will have a different animation and will be displayed in a different position of the screen. Will use this challenge to set the basis of context, providers and reducers from React.</p>

          <p>Tic-tac-toe is a classic game that can be implemented using React and TailwindCSS. It is a two-player game where the players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. By the end of this day, you will have a fully functional, animated tic-tac-toe game.</p>

          <p>In this case, it will create a system that allows the user to search for a GIF and display it. It will use the GIPHY API to search for GIFs. The gif selected will be able to copy the URL to the clipboard.</p>
